# What next?

You've done the workshop and made Gong!

You want to learn more about Unity, do some projects which let you take it at your own pace.
What's good?

## Recap

We might've gone through everything a bit quickly in the workshop, so it could be a good idea to cast your eye over what we did.

I've included annotated and refactored versions of the three scripts we wrote in this repo at [/scripts](https://github.com/unwitting/unity-workshop/tree/master/scripts), they're probably worth a read!

## Tutorials / guides

Unity have a bunch of great tutorials covering loads of different types of games, so whatever you want to make you'll have a fun option.
They provide all the art and sound assets for you for free, and help you make the game every step of the way.

Working through one or two of these is definitely my recommended way to learn more and gain familiarity with Unity.

Head to [unity3d.com/learn/tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) and look into pretty much any of the guides there that jump out at you.
It might be a good idea to go through the small set called [Interactive Tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/interactive-tutorials) first to recap the kinds of things we covered and add other key Unity features.

## Take part in a jam!

Game jams are like hackathons for games.
The idea is usually that a _theme_ gets announced either before the time, or as it begins, and you build a game that relates to the theme.

The best way to find some good casual jams to take part in is to go to [itch.io/jams](https://itch.io/jams) where there's a massive calendar of all the public ones you can join.

They're very low-pressure, and the focus is really on small, unpolished games.
Nobody expects something incredible from a game jam, everybody's there to learn and have fun.

If you take part on itch.io, you'll submit your game to the site so that people can play it for free (bonus: itch is a really good place to find lesser-known indie games!)

## Resources

A very quick note about game resources, since this is something that really got me down a lot when I was first playing with game dev.

If you want art, or sounds, or music for your game... you can get it free.
If it's not your thing to _make_ art, sounds or music, I _highly_ recommend that you do get it for free.

It can be fun to try, and it may be your skills lend you to it more than me, but it can be frustrating to think that you need to make all the creative content for your game yourself when in reality there's tons of quality free-to-use stuff online.

Here're some of the best places to go.

* [kenney.nl](http://kenney.nl/assets) is the king of free assets. Kenney has made hundreds and hundreds of terrain tiles, item sprites, sound effects, UI elements, you name it. Have a browse and you'll find something to inspire you.
* [freesound](https://freesound.org/) is a great place to find free-to-use sound effects and music for a game. Again, explore it, it's good fun.

Above all, have fun, Google everything. The [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) is your friend.

I'd love to see what you make! [Let me know](https://github.com/unwitting/unity-workshop/blob/master/contact_jack.md) if you do.
