# Unity workshop

Thanks for your interest in learning Unity!

In the workshop, we'll be creating a basic game called **Gong**. It's like Pong, but there's only one paddle and the ball has some bouncy physics!

## Getting ready

Before the session, please do the following:

1. Download Unity Personal edition from [here](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) (choose _Installer for Mac OSX_ rather than the _Unity Hub_ button).
2. Follow the Unity installer to get it installed and ready on your Mac.
3. Fire up Unity! If it asks you to create an account and sign in, you'll need to do that.
4. Once you can get to a Unity screen that looks like this, you're as far as you need to go:

5. Finally, download the project base package (we'll cover how to import and use this in the session, but it's good to have the file ready) from [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/unwitting/unity-workshop/c0b752c8/gong_base.unitypackage) and keep it somewhere safe on your drive (it's also in this repo at [/gong_base.unitypackage](https://github.com/unwitting/unity-workshop/blob/master/gong_base.unitypackage)).

## What will we cover?

We'll start from a basic, but not totally empty, base project that I've prepared: setting up some of the elements of this would be a bit of a boring waste of our time in the class, but rest assured I'll go over anything important.

Time permitting, we'll cover the following:

1. What on Earth am I seeing? A quick tour of the Unity editor. It can be a little complex at first sight, so we'll de-mystify it a little before we get cracking.
2. Adding an object to the game world with a sprite (or, _what is a sprite?_)
3. Adding some 2D physics without a line of code (or, _what are Unity components?_)
4. Scripting the game with C#! We'll add keyboard controls, a score counter and a reset mechanism.

I'll also try to make sure we have ample time for questions and some general chat about my work, if you're interested.

## What do I need to know?

You should have everything you need already. You haven't covered C# in your course, but you _have_ written a lot of Java. They're very similar languages (honestly, very very similar: the C# we'll be writing is almost valid Java without any changes).
