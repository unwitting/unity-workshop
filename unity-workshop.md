# Unity workshop

Thanks for your interest in learning Unity!

In the workshop, we'll be creating a basic game called **Gong**. It's like Pong, but there's only one paddle and ball has some bouncy physics!

## Getting ready

Before the session, please do the following:

1. Download Unity Personal edition from [here](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) (choose _Installer for Mac OSX_ rather than the _Unity Hub_ button)
1. Follow the Unity installer to get it installed and ready on your Mac
1. If it asks you to create a Unity account and sign in, you'll need to do that
